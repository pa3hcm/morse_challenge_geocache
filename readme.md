# Morse Challenge Geocache

Geocaching is a popular hobby around the world. This code is used for a
cache nearby my house. It's easy to find, but difficult to open: you
have to show some morse code skills before you can access the logbook!

The building of the cache is still in progress. When finished, I will
publish an article on my blog: http://www.pa3hcm.nl/
